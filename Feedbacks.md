Tamar,

You did a great project and your idea is well executed.
Your code is clean and readable. 
Adding a bit more structure with folders, would make your project even more organized and easier to understand.

I especially appreciate the comments you added to each function and step; they make it much easier to follow your logic and decisions.

You successfully used all the features we learned in class, excellent work! This makes your Hackathon project feel complete.

Great job, keep up the good work!
